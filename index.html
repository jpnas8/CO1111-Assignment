            Our Goal: Develop a Web Application, more specifically a fun treasure hunt game! <br><br>
            We are also developing this as an assignment for module CO1111: The Computing Challenge! <br>
        </div>

        <div id="game_explanation">
            For this game, players will have to connect their Mobile Web Application and get access to clues <br>
            or questions to progress in the treasure hunt. <br>
            The players will be able to access a leaderboard and live question at anytime during a hunt, <br>
            or have a practice session with fake treasure hunts and scores. <br><br>
