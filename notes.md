I started working on the assignment by creating the index page, the stylesheet and the GitHub rep.
I intend to work on the backend part of the web app, while Miranda will work on the styling, structure, and front end of the project.
For now, I have just created a simple web template as a starting point for the team, and we will expand from here. Until next log.
