I started working on the assignment by creating the index page, the stylesheet and the GitHub rep.
I intend to work on the backend part of the web app, while Miranda will work on the styling, structure, and front end of the project.
For now, I have just created a simple web template as a starting point for the team, and we will expand from here. Until next log.

Update: we held our first meeting today as well, we talked about the project and how to split the work, and gave suggestions regarding the landing page.
Also, I managed to work on getting all the treasure hunt info using JS (fetch), and Miranda started styling the page as she likes it, it will be her design choices.

During the labs I was working on a bit of css (gradient background) and steered the course of the project. Added some context in the landing page, created the page for the
treasure hunt game with a link including style and functionality.
